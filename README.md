# Titanic Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project explores the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to understand passenger survival trends.  
The goal is to perform **data analysis and visualization** without coding, using tools like **Excel and Tableau**, and communicate insights clearly.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger information from the Titanic shipwreck, including:
- `PassengerId` – Unique ID  
- `Survived` – Survival status (No, Yes)  
- `Pclass` – Passenger class (1, 2, 3)  
- `Name` – Passenger name  
- `Sex` – Gender  
- `Age` – Age in years  
- `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard  
- `Fare` – Ticket price  
- `Embarked` – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Analysis Questions
The project explores the following questions:
1. What percentage of passengers survived?  
2. How did **gender** affect survival rates?  
3. How did **passenger class** affect survival rates?  
4. How did **age groups** affect survival?  
5. Did **port of embarkation** influence survival rates?
6. How did **gender and age** influence survival rates?

## Visualizations / Dashboard
Here are the main visual insights from the analysis:

### 1. Overall Survival Rate
![Overall Survival Rate](screenshots/overall_survival.png)  
> Insight: XX% of passengers survived, while XX% did not survive.

### 2. Survival by Gender
![Survival by Gender](screenshots/survival_by_gender.png)  
> Insight: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

### 3. Survival by Passenger Class
![Survival by Class](screenshots/survival_by_class.png)  
> Insight: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd and 3rd class passengers.

### 4. Age Distribution by Survival
![Age Distribution](screenshots/age_distribution.png)  
> Insight: Children had higher survival rates compared to adults.

### 5. Survival by Port of Embarkation
![Survival by Port](screenshots/survival_by_port.png)  
> Insight: Passengers embarking from [Port Name] had a higher survival rate.

## Key Insights
- Gender and passenger class were the strongest factors affecting survival.  
- Age also influenced survival, with children more likely to survive.  
- The port of embarkation had some impact on survival rates.
